      <h1 class="text-center">Hello there! :)</h1><br>
      <p>Thanks for your visit! I hope you will enjoy my little promo page. I am sure you want to know a little about the person behind this page. (Well that's why you clicked in the about me section,isn't it?)<br>
      Let's see. I'm a fresh junior front-end web developer! I started dealing with it for about 1 year ago, on a friend's advice. Well I was always interested in programing. 
      I've always thinked it's an interesting and wonderfull profession to make beautifull thinks with just typing. But I never felt like I'm smart enough for that... 
      But when I tried it one year ago I loved it right away! It's a little bit challenging, a little bit hard sometimes, but in the and you always get the reward: you can see the fruit of your work. And I'm always proud for it!<br><br>
      In my personal life I'm a tipical geek guy too. I like to play videogames (but I'm pretty noob), my gamer name is Hir0ta. I love movies, especially sci-fi, fantasy, comic-based movies too. Of course I love comics too (I'm on the Marvel's side, but I like DC-s too),but I also like animes and mangas.<br><br>
      My other favorite hobby is the scale modelling! Because I'm also a carguy, but unfortunatly my favorite cars are extremely rare (some of them even in Japan too) I build theme in little! I will show them in hobbies later.<br><br>
      Well thats would be me. I'm not really a interesting guy,but I hope you will enjoy the rest of the page! And once again: <br><h3 class="text-center">Thanks for coming!</h3>
